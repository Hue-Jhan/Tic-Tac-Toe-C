# Difficulty
The function checkwinner is the simple win condition.
The functions CheckWinnerX and CheckWinnerY are the "Difficulty", they detect if you are close to winning in any possible way, then send the X and Y coordinates to the TurnoCompiuter function (ComputerTurn) and promptly stop you.
You can comment some of those to lower the difficulty, also sorry if some of the functions or variables are in Italian : (

This program also contains a Turn counter, a Player Displayer, and a "play again" function.
